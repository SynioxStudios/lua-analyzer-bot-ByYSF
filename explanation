Lua Script Deobfuscator
───────────────────────

What this does:
• Takes obfuscated Lua scripts (like WeAreDevs ones) and tries to make them readable
• Shows you what strings are hidden inside
• Runs scripts in a sandbox so they don't break your computer
• Points out suspicious patterns

How to use:
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Run: python main_orchestrator.py your_script.lua
3. Check the output file it creates

Files:
• sandbox_engine.lua - runs Lua code safely
• string_analyzer.py - finds and decodes hidden strings  
• script_processor.py - runs scripts and gets info
• main_orchestrator.py - main script you actually run

Why this exists:
People keep obfuscating Lua scripts and my community wants to deobfuscate, so here you go :) 

Works on:
• WeAreDevs obfuscated scripts (mostly)
• Other Lua obfuscation that uses similar tricks
• Might work on other stuff, no promises
